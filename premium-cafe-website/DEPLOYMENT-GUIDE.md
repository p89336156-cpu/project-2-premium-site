To replace them:

Example:
```html
<!-- OLD (placeholder) -->
<div class="illustration-placeholder banh-mi-illustration">
    <span class="placeholder-text">🥖 Bánh Mì Illustration Here</span>
</div>

<!-- NEW (with your image) -->
<img src="images/banh-mi.png" alt="Delicious Bánh Mì" class="banh-mi-image">
